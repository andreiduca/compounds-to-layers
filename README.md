# compounds-to-layers
Illustrator script to extract compound shapes and create separate layers from them.

## Usage
Use this script on a file with only one artboard and one or more layers with multiple objects per layer.

To run the script, go to File -> Scripts -> Other Script and browse for the `CompoundsToLayers.jsx` file.

## What's it good for?
The script can be used on vector icons collections, where all icons are objects on the same layer and extractor scripts (such as [MultiExporter.jsx](https://gist.github.com/TomByrne/7816376)) won't work.
